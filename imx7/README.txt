This directory is intended for cross-development tools targeting
Compulab's CL-SOM-iMX7, based on the NXP i.MX7 processor family
of dual-core ARM Cortex-A7 CPUs with a real-time ARM Cortex-M4
co-processor.

In particular, these tools are (at least originally) related to
the Freescale Linux provided with the SB-SOM-iMX7 development
kit.

The Compulab wike recommends the Linaro toolchain gcc V5.5.0, but I will
assume that we might try other versions, and hence create a subdirectory
structure allowing for some growth.
